1.High-level conceptual: Data is represented how it is in the real world.
For the user.

2.Record based and Logical Data Model: Easy for the user to use, and data is stored 
how it should be in the computer.There are three types.

-Relational Databases: Structured around tables, 
using rows and columns to store and manage data. 

-Hierarchical Databases: Data is organized in a tree-like structure, 
where each record has a single parent and multiple children. 
It's efficient for representing one-to-many relationships.

-Network Databases: Similar to hierarchical databases but with more complex relationships. 
Records can have multiple parents, enabling a more intricate structure.

3.Physical data model: Data is stored,arranged and retrieved at the physical layer.

4.Object-Oriented Databases: Store data as objects, allowing for complex data types, 
methods, and inheritance, suitable for object-oriented programming.

5.Centralized Databases: All data is stored in a single location or server, 
accessible by multiple users.

6.Distributed Databases: Data is distributed across multiple locations or 
servers connected via a network. Offers benefits in scalability and fault tolerance.

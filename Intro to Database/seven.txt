Three-Schema Architecture:

Conceptual Schema (Logical Level):
Represents the logical structure of the entire database.
Defines the relationships between different data entities, 
their attributes, constraints, and the overall data model.
Acts as an intermediary between the external and internal schemas, 
providing a conceptual understanding of the database's structure without 
specifying implementation details.

Internal Schema (Physical Level):
Represents the physical storage and organization of data on the storage devices.
Defines how the data is stored in terms of file structures, indexing, storage allocation, 
and access paths.Hides the physical storage complexities from the conceptual 
and external levels, focusing on optimizing data storage and retrieval.

External Schema (View Level):
Represents the way data is viewed or accessed by end-users or specific applications.
Focuses on providing different user views of the data based on specific requirements.
Allows for customizations, hiding sensitive information, and presenting data in a 
format suitable for individual user needs without affecting the overall database structure.

Advantages of Three-Schema Architecture:

Data Independence: It offers both logical and physical data independence. 
Changes made at the internal level (physical storage) do not affect the 
conceptual and external schemas. Similarly, modifications at the conceptual 
level do not impact external views. This enables flexibility and easier maintenance.

Abstraction and Clarity: The architecture separates different levels of abstraction, 
making it easier to understand and manage the database system. 
Users interact with the external schema, shielded from underlying complexities, 
while developers focus on the conceptual and internal levels for design and implementation.

Customization and Security: It allows for customized views (external schemas) 
tailored to specific user requirements while ensuring data security by 
controlling access through these external views. Sensitive data can be restricted 
from certain user views, enhancing security measures.

Scalability and Flexibility: As changes or enhancements are needed, the three-schema 
architecture facilitates modification at individual levels without affecting the entire system. 
This scalability allows for adaptation to evolving business needs without disrupting
existing functionalities.

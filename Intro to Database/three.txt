DBMS-
System that manages the databases.

Need for DBMS:
Data Organization: Databases provide a structured and organized way to store 
and manage vast amounts of data. This structured format allows for efficient retrieval, 
manipulation, and storage of information.

Data Integrity: They ensure data accuracy and consistency. 
With defined rules and constraints, databases maintain the quality 
and reliability of the stored information.

Efficient Retrieval: Databases enable quick and precise retrieval of specific data, 
even from large datasets, by using queries and indexing methods.

Concurrency and Access Control: They allow multiple users to access and 
manipulate data concurrently while ensuring proper control over who can access, 
modify, or delete data.

Scalability: Databases can handle growing amounts of data without compromising performance. 
They are designed to scale and accommodate increasing data volumes.

Security: They offer security features like user authentication, access control mechanisms, 
and encryption to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or breaches.

Redundancy Control: Databases help manage data redundancy, 
minimizing duplicate data storage and ensuring consistency across records.
